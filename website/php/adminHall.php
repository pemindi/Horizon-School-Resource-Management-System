  <h2>Lecture hall</h2></br>
  
  <p class = "font"></br>
  A lecture hall is a large room used for instruction, typically at a college or university.
   Unlike a traditional classroom with a capacity from one to four dozen, the capacity of lecture halls is typically measured 
   in the hundreds. Lecture halls are designed mainly as education content and information delivery to groups, 
   but may also be used for interactive learning and discussion. 
   The spaces are also multi-purpose in nature enabling flexible layouts that enable active learning for medium-sized groups
